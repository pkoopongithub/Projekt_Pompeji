<h1>Escape across the Tisza</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file6.png" style="width:6in;height:5.78125in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It was still early in the morning when the team gathered in the briefing room at Franciscan College in Steubenville. The first rays of sunlight broke through the morning light and bathed the room in a soft gold, but the atmosphere was anything but relaxed. A bright neon light flickered above the table, which was littered with documents and notes. The air was filled with a mix of concentration and nervousness as each individual sensed that what lay ahead could have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>A large map hung dominantly on the wall, on which the planned route through Romania and along the Tisza was marked in bright red. The map lines seemed to pulse, as if the route itself was breathing, as the team gathered around the table. The Zoom conference flickered on a large screen, showing the faces of ARS, Michael Phillips and Agent Novak.</p>
<p>Agent Novak, the I.R.A.R.A.H operations manager, was already in front of the camera, his gaze steady and focused. “Good morning, everyone,” he began, his voice radiating both authority and concern. “Our mission is clear: we must bring two men safely out of Ukraine – a Ukrainian pacifist and a Russian deserter. The Tisza is the last barrier we must overcome before returning to Romania. This region is under strict surveillance and we only have a small window of opportunity.”</p>
<p>A murmur passed through the room as the gravity of the task seeped in. Everyone in the room knew that their actions held the fate of these men in their hands. The combination of fear and determination was palpable in the air.</p>
<p>The screen changed to ARS, the artificial intelligence they had supporting them in this critical mission. Her soothing, almost human voice filled the room: “The escape route was carefully planned. We recorded the positions of the border patrols and selected the safest point for crossing the Tisza. Communication during the mission will take place via encrypted channels. Michael will stay in touch at all times via satellite phone.”</p>
<p>Michael Phillips, who served as team leader, nodded in agreement. His eyes held a mixture of confidence and concern as he turned to his team. “Remember, the lives of these men are in our hands. Any wrong step could mean we're exposed. So stay calm and focused. It’s important that we work together as a team.”</p>
<p>He looked at the faces of his colleagues and noticed the determination reflected in their features. But he could also sense the uncertainty that hovered like a shadow over the room. “We have everything prepared and I trust your abilities. If we stick together and support each other, we can overcome this challenge.”</p>
<p>A quick nod, an encouraging smile here and there, and the tension in the room slowly began to ease. They were not alone in this fight; everyone knew they were strong as a unit, united by a common goal.</p>
<p>“Now for the details,” Michael continued, turning back to the map. “We will meet in a small village on the banks of the Tisza. The contact person is waiting for us there and will lead us to the men. The escape must be quick and quiet - no lights, no noises. Each of us has a role and we must stick to the plan. Questions?"</p>
<p>A few hands went up and Michael answered the questions with clear, concise answers. As he said the last word, he felt the team was ready.</p>
<p>“Good, we don’t have much time. Gather your gear and meet in the garage area in half an hour. Everyone knows what to do.”</p>
<p>The team stood and as they left the room, the determination was palpable in their steps. Michael stood there a moment longer, looking at the map in front of him. The lines drawn in red seemed to beat like a pulse, and he couldn't help but think about the responsibility that rested on his shoulders.</p>
<p>“ARS,” he murmured, and the artificial intelligence promptly replied, “Yes, Michael?”</p>
<p>“Are there any risks we might have missed?”</p>
<p>“All relevant information is included in the analysis. The probabilities are favorable as long as we stick to the established time frame and do not deviate from the plan.”</p>
<p>One last deep breath, then Michael turned to leave. The challenge was great, but amid the uncertainties, the opportunity to save two lives seemed worth the effort.</p>
<p>The mission was underway and time was ticking mercilessly. They had to hurry because the Tisza River was not just a geographical obstacle - it was a symbol of freedom and hope that they sought in this dangerous world.</p>
<p>The team boarded a flight from New York to Bucharest, the passengers strapped into their seats as the clouds spread out beneath them like an endless sea. In the first class, where the I.R.A.R.A.H team was seated, the atmosphere was filled with tense anticipation. Captain Lukas Berger, an experienced ocean captain with a deep understanding of the dangers of escape, leaned forward slightly and spoke in a voice that exuded both respect and authority.</p>
<p>“The current on the Tisza is unpredictable,” he explained with a serious look as he studied the map of the river that lay on the table. “We have to be quick and quiet. The boat's engine is muted, but any movement can attract attention. The region is being closely monitored.”</p>
<p>Julia, who was sitting next to him, listened attentively. Her eyes were serious and she knew that the responsibility they bore was not an easy one to shoulder. “Each of us has to do our part perfectly. Our mistakes must not endanger the freedom of others,” she replied firmly, internalizing the gravity of her mission.</p>
<p>In another row, Michael Doppelganger and Dr. Neumann, the professor they had previously brought to safety. Their conversation was quiet, almost muffled, as they discussed the increasing surveillance of technology and the gradual erosion of personal freedom. Dr. Neumann looked pensively out the window, as if he were looking at the clouds that hovered above the earth like unfulfilled thoughts. “Transhumanism and cancel culture go hand in hand,” he murmured. “They are trying to stifle discourse through control, and technology is being used as a tool.”</p>
<p>Michael Doppelgänger nodded vigorously. “That’s why we have to show that freedom is different than technological superiority. This is the mission of I.R.A.R.A.H. Our values are inextricably linked to human dignity.”</p>
<p>After landing in Bucharest, they felt the pressure of the task ahead. The journey to Sighetu Marmației, a border town on the Tisza, was long and tiring. The journey took almost nine hours, and as they rolled through the picturesque landscapes marked by the remnants of past conflicts, ARS took control of communications. “You are approaching the river,” said the soothing voice of ARS over the encrypted radio. “Stick to the planned route. I have real-time visibility of patrol movements.”</p>
<p>The landscape they passed was melancholy yet beautiful, with sprawling fields and old, weather-beaten villages that whispered stories of hope and despair. When they finally arrived at the agreed location, they parked the vehicle in a secluded, shady spot where the thick undergrowth protected them from the prying eyes of passers-by.</p>
<p>The quiet, soothing sound of the river could be heard in the air as they moved through the thicket on foot. With every step the tension seemed to grow. Eventually they discovered the boat provided by I.R.A.R.A.H, hidden among tall trees, with a muffled engine patiently waiting to be started.</p>
<p>The sky was covered in ominous, dark clouds that seemed like a harbinger of their mission. As the team climbed into the boat and the engines started, a rush of adrenaline broke the tense silence. Captain Berger took the wheel and navigated the cold, dark waters of the Tisza. The current was stronger than he expected, but his experience kept him calm and focused. “We are approaching the meeting point,” ARS reported over the radio. “The men are hidden in a forest on the Ukrainian bank. We only have a few minutes to find her.”</p>
<p>The others stared intently at the horizon, and when they finally reached the other side of the river, they saw two figures emerge from the bushes. Their faces were a picture of exhaustion and nervousness, marked by fear and hope. “Quick, come on board!” Julia called out to them and hastily helped them into the boat. As soon as the men were safely on board, Captain Berger pushed the boat with all his strength back to the Romanian shore.</p>
<p>Suddenly a light flashed on the horizon - a patrol was visible in the distance. “Hurry up!” Berger shouted, and the boat’s engine roared as he pushed the throttle forward. The boat splashed through the water as Michael Doppelganger held a cloth cloak over the side to hide her from the headlights. “Stay calm!” Julia whispered as she watched the men, whose tension was palpable. "Everything will be fine. We are on the right track.”</p>
<p>Finally they reached the shore on the Romanian side. They hastily pulled the boat into the thicket, and a local I.R.A.R.A.H contact was waiting to help them hide the boat and dispose of it later. “We will sink it so there are no traces,” the contact explained quietly, his eyes restlessly scanning the area. “ARS showed us a safe escape route. But we have to hurry. The patrols could be here any minute.”</p>
<p>They quickly helped the rescued men out of the boat and led them through the thicket to a small, remote Jesuit monastery that served as a refuge for refugees. The Jesuits had already made arrangements to receive the men and provide them with new identities. An older priest with a calm look and a gentle smile greeted them. “You risked a lot to bring these men here,” he said in a voice that conveyed both calm and comfort. “They are safe now and we will take care of them.”</p>
<p>Julia felt a wave of relief wash over her as she said goodbye to those she had rescued. "It's good to know they've found refuge here," she whispered as the pressure lifted from her shoulders and her heart lightened.</p>
<p>After bringing those rescued to safety, the team set off for Hungary. They chose a remote route across the border to avoid detection and eventually reached a small town in northeastern Hungary where they were able to regroup. Michael contacted Julia via the satellite phone. “You did it. I.R.A.R.A.H has confirmed that no evidence of your presence remains. Good job."</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Julia replied. “But we know that this is just the beginning.” The mission had ended successfully, but the next challenges were already waiting.</p>
<p>Julia was preparing to start work as a social worker and psychological counselor in Hungary, while Martina wanted to get a foothold in archaeology. But deep down everyone knew that the period of calm would be short-lived. The escape across the Tisza was only a small victory in the fight against oppression, and the waves of change it had unleashed would not stop.</p>
<p>In the coming days, as they settled into their new lives, news of new repressions in Ukraine and Russia became increasingly urgent. The team knew they had to prepare. Agent Novak contacted them with new instructions. “The situation is getting worse,” he said on the phone, his voice sounding worried. “We have reports of an impending large-scale military exercise at the border. We must keep our eyes open and be ready to act immediately.”</p>
<p>“This is giving us no peace,” Julia mumbled as she hung up the phone. “But we are ready. Always ready.”</p>
<p>The dangerous mission on the Tisza was completed, but the danger was not over. Their journey had made them stronger, and the determination in their hearts burned brighter than ever. Together they would take on the next mission I.R.A.R.A.H entrusted to them, no matter how challenging it might be.</p>
