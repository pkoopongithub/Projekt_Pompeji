<h1>See you again in Budapest</h1>

<p>The cool morning air enveloped Michael as he stood in front of the entrance to the College Germanicum in Rome. The stone building with its old walls seemed to say goodbye to him silently. He felt the weight of the years he had spent here and the memories stored within the walls. The sun broke through the clouds and bathed the facades in a soft, golden light. With one last look at the familiar surroundings, he let the heavy wooden door close behind him.</p>
<p>Maria was waiting for him outside, wrapped in a light cloak that fluttered gently in the morning wind. Her gaze was calm, but there was an expression in her eyes that made Michael pause for a moment. It was the look of a woman who had a lot to say but kept the words trapped in silence.</p>
<p>“So, the time has come,” she said, her voice soft but laced with a melancholy that made the air around her heavy. “You leave and leave everything behind.”</p>
<p>Michael nodded slowly. “Yes, it’s time. There is a lot to do in Budapest.” He paused briefly and looked deep into her eyes. "I hope you know that I'm still thinking about you... and everything we shared."</p>
<p>A slight smile crossed Maria's lips, but her eyes revealed a deeper story. “Take care of yourself, Michael. It’s good to know you don’t forget the family.”</p>
<p>For a moment it seemed as if there was more in her words than she was saying. Michael knew that the hint of the doppelganger's past and identity stood between them like an unspoken shadow. He bowed his head and, without another word, turned away to head for the taxi that would take him to the airport.</p>
<p>The flight to Budapest was quiet. As he looked out the window at the landscape passing below him, his thoughts revolved around what lay before him - and what he had left behind in Rome. The thought of Maria, of the unspoken words that floated between them, came to the forefront. As the plane landed at Budapest airport, a familiar tingle of anticipation ran through his body. It was not only a new task that was waiting for him, but also the opportunity to finally create clarity.</p>
<p>A black car was waiting for him. The journey through the city took him past the Danube and the magnificent buildings that shone in the golden evening light. The water sparkled in the twilight and seemed to reflect the past and future as he made his way to the small apartment that Julia and Martina had come to call home. They had settled in well and seemed to have found a new purpose in Budapest.</p>
<p>When the car stopped in front of the old building, Michael took a deep breath. Mature trees framed the entrance and the familiar sounds of the city filled the air. He rang the bell and waited, his thoughts continuing to revolve around the unspoken truth that had brought him here.</p>
<p>The door opened and Martina greeted him with a warm smile that eased some of the tension from his shoulders. “Michael, good to see you. Come in, we’ve been waiting for you.”</p>
<p>There was a homely atmosphere in the living room. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the room, and there were cakes and pastries on the coffee table that looked like little works of art. Julia came out of the kitchen, a tray in her hands, which she set down with a beaming smile. “You’re finally here,” she said, looking at Michael with an expression of relief. “Sit down, grab some coffee. We have a lot to discuss.”</p>
<p>Michael sat down on one of the old sofas, which were upholstered in a lovely but worn fabric. The coziness of the room gave him a feeling of home that he had missed for a long time. Shortly afterwards the doppelganger also entered the room. He seemed relaxed but also a little nervous as he sat down opposite Michael. “Welcome to Budapest,” he said with a slight smile that betrayed both openness and uncertainty. “It’s nice to have the whole ‘family’ together.”</p>
<p>The word “family” sounded unusually familiar to Michael, and for a brief moment the expression on the doppelganger’s face seemed to reveal a deeper connection. Michael returned the smile as a thought crossed his mind - was it really possible that this young man was his son?</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Michael said, taking a sip of his coffee, which was warm and aromatic. “It feels good to be here.”</p>
<p>They chatted about trivial things – the city, work and life in Budapest. But between the conversations there was an unspoken question, a tension that neither Julia nor Martina seemed to resolve. The doppelganger occasionally shot Michael glances that were imbued with an intense interest, as if he was seeking confirmation that Michael had not yet expressed.</p>
<p>Dinner was relaxed. The conversations were light and full of laughter, but when they finally sat down on the balcony in the twilight, a kind of quiet understanding hung over the scene. Michael knew it was time to seek answers—and that he might already have them.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he began quietly as the first stars lit up in the sky, “life takes us down unexpected paths that we only understand later.” He looked at the doppelganger and noticed that he was following his words carefully. “And sometimes we meet people who show us that there are more connections than we initially believe.”</p>
<p>Night fell over Budapest and the city lights twinkled like little sparks, throwing memories into the darkness. The looks they exchanged spoke volumes as the silence of the evening surrounded them. Michael knew it would take time to fully speak the truth, but for that moment, being together was enough.</p>
<p>The family had taken on a new dimension - one that he hadn't expected, but perhaps had always hoped for. And while the gentle sound of the Danube could be heard in the distance, Michael knew that this was just the beginning of a long and exciting journey.</p>
