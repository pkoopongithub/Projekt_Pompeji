<h1>Clothed in truth</h1>

<p>The morning was cool and foggy when Julia, Martina and Michael's doppelgänger arrived on the Kassel University campus. A leaden haze hung over the buildings, and the tense atmosphere was almost palpable. The day didn't start like any other, and they felt it in their bones. Already in the distance they saw the first protest signs raised into the cloudy sky: “Against fascism and enemies of science!” and “Away with the reactionary!” echoed from a group of demonstrators who had gathered in front of the main building.</p>
<p>“It won’t be easy,” Julia whispered, looking around with a worried expression. Her eyes scanned the crowd, packed into an angry mosaic of faces and signs.</p>
<p>“We have to hurry,” said Michael’s doppelganger, straightening his shoulders as they stood like a shield against the approaching cold. “The professor is waiting for us. The quicker we get him out of here, the less chance they have of recognizing us.”</p>
<p>Martina nodded and cast a searching glance at the gray clouds that covered the sky as if they were summoning some unwritten omen. “I.R.A.R.A.H has prepared everything. Let’s not waste any time.”</p>
<p>They slipped discreetly into one of the outbuildings, their steps quick but controlled. The sound of protests outside grew louder, but inside the university building was quiet. The contrast felt surreal. In the sparsely furnished office they found Dr. Tobias Neumann, who was hurriedly packing his things into a worn leather bag.</p>
<p>He was a middle-aged man, with sharp features and a look of exhaustion and determination in his eyes that lay deep in their sockets like two shadows in a dark alley.</p>
<p>As the team entered, he looked up and breathed a sigh of relief. “I’ve been waiting for you,” he said and put the bag down. “The situation outside is getting worse. The demonstrators are particularly aggressive today.” His voice was a rough thread that ran through the tense air.</p>
<p>“We have everything prepared,” said Michael’s doppelganger calmly, taking a brown Franciscan habit out of his pocket. “Here is your religious habit. As soon as you put it on, you are officially Brother Timothy – a Franciscan on his way to the USA.”</p>
<p>Martina handed him a fake ID card. “I.R.A.R.A.H made sure you had a new identity. Your religious name and your new existence are secured.” The words weighed heavily on the professor’s shoulders, who felt the weight of his situation.</p>
<p>Dr. Neumann stared at the habit before standing up resolutely. “This is crazy,” he muttered as he wrapped himself in the brown habit. “But I have no choice.”</p>
<p>As soon as he was finished, they led him outside through the empty hallways of the university building. An inconspicuous van was parked in front of the door, but getting there was not without risk. The protests outside the university had become louder, and the crowd seemed heated about the professor's upcoming lecture.</p>
<p>“We have to get through this,” Julia said, scanning the crowd. “They mustn’t notice that it’s you. We only have a short time.”</p>
<p>“I will go ahead with him,” said Michael’s doppelganger resolutely. “You should believe we are a group of Franciscans on a pilgrimage.”</p>
<p>Dr. Neumann shook his head as they slowly moved toward the crowd. “It’s crazy what these groups have become,” he whispered. “They used to be intellectual. Today they are paid demonstrators from left-wing communities who are here just to cause a ruckus.”</p>
<p>The protesters barely noticed them as they pushed their way through the crowd. Some shouted insults, others raised their signs, but no one seemed to recognize them. But then, just before they reached the van, there was a shout from the crowd: “That’s him! The reactionary professor!”</p>
<p>The protesters' eyes turned to her, and for a moment it seemed as if the situation was escalating. The crowd's pulse quickened like the roar of an approaching storm. But Michael's doppelganger pushed Dr. Neumann quickly into the van. The door closed with a thud and they drove off, angry shouts ringing out behind them.</p>
<p>On the motorway to Frankfurt it was quiet in the car, but the tension was still palpable, like a rope being overstretched. The professor leaned back and sighed heavily, the pressure on his chest seemingly easing momentarily. “Discussions used to be possible,” he said thoughtfully. “Today all I see is anger and ignorance. Antifa was once an intellectual movement, but now it has become an instrument of hate. They are paid to silence those who think differently.”</p>
<p>“You’re no longer interested in arguments,” Martina agreed. “It’s just a matter of destroying the enemy.”</p>
<p>“It’s a sad development,” Michael’s lookalike added. “But in the USA you will have a new chance. There you can speak freely without being threatened by cancel culture.”</p>
<p>The professor nodded, but his thoughts still seemed to linger on the events in Germany. “It's hard to believe how quickly things have changed. We have surrendered our critical thinking to technology. I hope to be able to save something in the USA.”</p>
<p>When they arrived at Frankfurt Airport, the team led the professor through security checks. Every step had to be planned precisely because a single mistake could jeopardize their entire operation. Julia glanced over her shoulder as the professor handed his papers to the security guards. It only took a moment, but what seemed like an eternity, for the officer to wave him through.</p>
<p>“Once you’re in the US, you’re safe,” Julia said, putting a hand on the professor’s shoulder. “I.R.A.R.A.H will take care of everything else.”</p>
<p>Dr. Neumann nodded, a hint of gratitude in his eyes. “Without your help I would have been lost,” he said quietly. “I owe you my life.”</p>
<p>They watched him go through the gate and the flight to Chicago was called. They took one last look at the man they had saved before he disappeared behind the glass doors.</p>
<p>Once in the United States, the professor was picked up by a member of the Franciscan community and taken to the Franciscan University of Steubenville. The team accompanied him on the long journey to the university, whose calm and peaceful atmosphere contrasted with the chaotic conditions in Germany. The trees that surrounded the campus acted like silent sentinels, protecting the new arrivals.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Brother Timothy,” one of the brothers greeted him with a warm smile. “Your reputation precedes you. We look forward to welcoming you to our community.”</p>
<p>"It will be an honor," the professor replied, nodding slightly, the weight of his new identity feeling both liberating and oppressive.</p>
<p>The day after his arrival, the professor gave his inaugural lecture to an assembled group of Franciscans and students. The team sat at the back of the room and listened intently as the professor chose his words carefully. The auditorium was filled with a quiet anticipation, the air seemed to vibrate as he spoke.</p>
<p>“At a time when people are handing over their responsibility to technology,” he began, “we must return to the values of enlightenment and rationality. It is not technology that will save us, but critical thinking. We must defend humanism against postmodern trends.”</p>
<p>The words echoed in the room, and for a moment it seemed as if the sharp edges of the world outside no longer had any power over her. A collective nod went through the ranks, the students seemed to sense the spark of hope that lay within the professors. But the reality couldn't be ignored for long.</p>
<p>After the lecture, Martina, Julia and Michael's doppelganger met with an I.R.A.R.A.H agent in one of the back rooms of the university. The agent was a slim man with a serious expression,</p>
<p>who sat across from them as they shared their impressions of what had happened.</p>
<p>“It was risky,” the agent said, his voice calm and controlled. “But we have information that some of the demonstrators in Germany have the goal of also infiltrating the Franciscan community. It could be that she is referring to Dr. Neumann are out.”</p>
<p>“What can we do?” Julia asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“We must ensure the safety of the professor and strengthen the connection with the community. He has become a target. The question is not if they will try to find him, but when.”</p>
<p>“That means we have to strengthen the defense,” Martina added. “He’s not just a professor. He is a symbol.”</p>
<p>The agent nodded. “Over the next few weeks, it will be crucial to secure our communications and keep an eye on movements in the community. It will take time to smooth out the waves that the events in Germany are bringing here.”</p>
<p>The next few days were characterized by intensive discussions about strategies to maintain the professor's safety. Meanwhile, Dr. Neumann, how he gradually grew into his new identity. He found that he had a voice that wanted to be heard in the new world - and he was encouraged by the opportunities he had here.</p>
<p>He gave lectures once a week and the auditorium filled with students who listened eagerly to his ideas. He remembered again and again the coldness of the demonstrations in Germany, the threats that had imprisoned his mind, and the heated debates that never led to anything. Here discussion was possible again and people's hearts were ready to open themselves to the ideas of humanism.</p>
<p>One evening, after a particularly encouraging talk, he sat at the table with his new brothers. “I never thought I would be so alive,” he said, raising his glass. “To freedom of spirit!”</p>
<p>“To freedom of spirit!” the others shouted in unison, and a feeling of community filled the room.</p>
<p>Dr. Neumann felt free for the first time in a long time, and when he looked at his brothers' faces, he knew he was safe. The shadows of the past seemed to fade as he walked the new path that lay before him.</p>
<p>In this new world he could share his knowledge and passion for the truth without fear of persecution. People no longer needed censorship, but rather the courage to stand up for the truth. And while darkness still raged in Germany, hope bloomed in the halls of Franciscan University.</p>
