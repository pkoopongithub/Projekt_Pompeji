<h1>The encounter in the simulation</h1>

<p>Martina was just logging out of the simulation when another figure suddenly appeared in front of her. Her heart skipped a beat as she recognized the person - it was Michael, but he looked much younger, almost her age. The resemblance to her father was so striking that it sent shivers down her spine. How could that be? It was as if the simulation had created a younger version of her father.</p>
<p>He approached her calmly, his steps quiet yet determined. His voice was deliberate, almost urgent, as he spoke:</p>
<p>@MARTINA: “Martina, we don’t have much time. Are you logged in with your mother in Pompeii?”</p>
<p>Martina felt her heart beating faster. Her confusion grew, but something about that figure, about his voice, made her think he knew what he was doing. She hesitated for just a moment before answering, "Yes... yes, I'm logged in with her."</p>
<p>The doppelganger nodded curtly. "In another reality, perhaps I could be your father," he said suddenly, as if he had guessed her thoughts.</p>
<p>Martina froze, surprised by this remark. What did he mean by that? She looked at him more closely. Was this really a version of her father? Or was this some kind of simulation trick? But before she could ask further, he spoke again, this time with an urgency in his voice that she couldn't ignore.</p>
<p>@MARTINA: “A black Mercedes will soon stop in front of the house. You must log out immediately, go to your mother and ask her to pack the essentials. You must delete all files on your system.”</p>
<p>Martina felt the pressure in his words. It was as if she had no choice. The situation was too serious to doubt. She nodded slightly, even though her thoughts were whirling wildly. What did he mean by an alternate reality? She wasn't a physicist, but as a historian she had heard of theories about multiverses and parallel worlds. Could that be possible? Was this man – or rather, this version of Michael – actually an alternate version of her father?</p>
<p>“Why do you look like my father?” she finally asked, her voice hesitant, almost a whisper. "Are you...?"</p>
<p>The doppelganger smiled slightly, almost mysteriously. “In another reality, that could be me, yes. But now you have to hurry. It’s about your safety.”</p>
<p>Martina was overwhelmed by the idea. But she knew this wasn't the time to look for answers. Without further hesitation, she did as he said. She frantically logged out of the simulation, jumped up and rushed down the stairs.</p>
<p>Her mother, Julia, was sitting downstairs in the living room, already worried. “What’s wrong, Martina?” she asked when she saw her daughter’s haste.</p>
<p>“We have to go immediately,” said Martina hastily. “Pack the essentials. A black Mercedes will pick us up soon.”</p>
<p>Julia looked at her confused, wanted to say something, but stopped herself. She had learned to trust her daughter in such moments and instead started packing some things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Martina deleted all the files on her laptop, just as the doppelganger had told her. Was he really an alternate version of her father? She didn't let the idea go. She had often read theories about parallel worlds, but it had always been something that was only considered speculative. Now it seemed to be getting real.</p>
<p>As she finished deleting the last document, she heard the faint hum of a car in front of the house. The black Mercedes was there. She opened the door, and to her amazement, the doppelganger was standing there - just like in the simulation.</p>
<p>Without another word, he helped her and her mother into the car and they drove off. Martina couldn't stop thinking about the doppelganger's words. Was that really her father from another reality? Or was it just a trick?</p>
<p>As they drove through the dark streets and the Mercedes glided effortlessly through the city, the question remained in Martina's mind. She felt her mind trying to think through all the possibilities. Could it really be that there were countless versions of them - and that this man was one of them?</p>
