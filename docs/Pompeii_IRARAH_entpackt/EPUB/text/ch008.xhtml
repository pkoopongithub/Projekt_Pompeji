<h1>Return to Rome and Pompeii</h1>

<p>On the train they stowed their suitcases in Martina's sleeping compartment, as Michael only went to Rome and only had one seat. Then they went to the dining car to order a coffee because they had already had breakfast.</p>
<p>“You have to go to the doctor, Michael,” Martina said seriously. It was the right time to address this. She was right; he would get his heart status checked. "Have you seen how impressive your simulation has become?" he deflected. “The architecture, the people on the streets, the hustle and bustle…”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Martina, “it’s really fascinating. I can well imagine how excited students will be about it. The benefits of the simulation will also be enormous for archeology.”</p>
<p>“I am very impressed with their work, and John Baker did an excellent job of integrating my dialogue grammar into the model. He sees, as I do, that the transformation tables for the chats have little to do with AI and are more reminiscent of Markov chains,” confirmed Michael. “But you’re also right that they have other goals. They are transhumanists.”</p>
<p>Martina looked at him questioningly. “The software agent Attilus appears to be capable of suffering and shows ethical scruples,” added Michael. So their conversation continued. Michael recounted that ARS had not answered his question about the software agents' consciousness, but instead stated that he would send a carrier pigeon. He called it “carrier pigeon” to make it clear that this was a backdoor he had given ARS to receive messages via a disguised IP address. “But this is implemented as a command and not as a standalone action routine for ARS. I expect to receive a “carrier pigeon” from ARS.”</p>
<p>“You all think like humanists,” Martina fumed. “You are moral, you are ethical, but ultimately you are all humanists. Your Teilhard de Chardin, your Nell Breuning, your Hoefnagels are no different than Sartre or Beauvoir. For you it is always only about the person, the distant person, but not about the close person, the one with whom you live. Mom always knew that.”</p>
<p>“Please leave Julia out of the game,” Michael asked. “But you’re right. It's easy to stand up for those you don't compete with, and it's hard to stand up for those who are like you and with whom you compete for the same thing. What is the commitment to suffering software agents worth if you have a secure life like us and accept the hardship and injustice of your fellow human beings as long as you yourself are doing well?”</p>
<p>So their conversation continued to Rome. Michael had a hard time saying goodbye to Martina as the train pulled into Roma Termini. Martina was tired too, and after they had warmly hugged and kissed and Michael had left the train, she got ready for her bed and slept the rest of the journey to Pompeii. She dreamed of her flight over Pompeii, of Michael and of her mother.</p>
