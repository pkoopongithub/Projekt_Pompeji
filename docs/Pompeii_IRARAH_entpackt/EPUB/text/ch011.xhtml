<h1>Conversation with the Provincial and the Rector</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file8.png" style="width:4.11093in;height:4.06457in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>After a week of thoughtful seclusion, Michael Phillips learned that the provincial and the rector wanted to visit him in San Pastore. Hope for a positive change was slim and he faced a problem that reminded him of Teilhard de Chardin. Perhaps they wanted to spare him the public humiliation on the stage in Rome.</p>
<p>A pavilion had been prepared in the park for a confidential conversation. Michael warmly greeted the rector and the provincial and took a seat when asked. The principal offered wine and got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“Michael, I don't have to tell you that you would fail if you tried to tell us that a new stage of evolution towards the Omega Point has taken place and conscious software agents have asked for church asylum,” the rector began. “But you don’t have to,” he added after a short pause, as if he wanted to give Michael the opportunity to object.</p>
<p>The Rector further reported that a few years ago, when Rome and Canterbury came closer together and established a common contact bishopric of the High Church, the North American Episcopal Church, the Anglican Church and the Vatican had founded a joint research center for Teilhard de Chardin. This also includes a data center with an interface to a register of 30 qubits. The Society of Jesus itself contributed to this through philosophical research into the Omega Point, which was also known to Michael. If it turns out that 30 qubits are sufficient, the superior general will approve the project after speaking to Michael.</p>
<p>Then the rector asked Michael to report on the Pompeii project. Michael described the details of the project, and the evening passed pleasantly, although Michael continued to transition from Teilhard de Chardin's theology to David Deutsch's multiverse model.</p>
<p>The next morning, Michael brought the Fiesta back, handed Maria the keys and resumed his work at the Gregoriana.</p>
