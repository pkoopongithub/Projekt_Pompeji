<h1>Arrival at the monastery in Germany</h1>

<p>The monastery was quiet and secluded in the thick darkness of the German countryside. The massive wooden doors opened with a soft creak and a motherly-looking woman with clever, piercing eyes stepped out, followed by two other sisters.</p>
<p>“Welcome,” said the superior friendly and motioned for them to enter. “You are safe here.”</p>
<p>Julia couldn't take it anymore. "Who is this man?" she asked sharply, her eyes fixed on young Michael. “Why does he look like my husband?”</p>
<p>The Mother Superior smiled knowingly, but her answer was vague. “Some things are beyond our understanding. Trust that you are safe here and let the rest go.”</p>
<p>Julia wanted to protest, but Martina stopped her again. It was clear that the Mother Superior knew more, but she wasn't ready to reveal everything. Julia bit her lip, but she wouldn't give up. Questions remained, and the answers had to come at some point.</p>
