<p>Thomas Mertens floated over the Bay of Naples with a lightness that gave him the feeling of absolute freedom. The west wind pressed gently against his outstretched wings, and with a subtle movement of his hand he steered against it so as not to lose the view of the Phlegraean fields and Misenum. Below him stretched the city, just as he had seen it in the historical depictions of the ancient port city. The city wall and the harbor were clearly visible. But he didn't fly any closer - he didn't want to take the risk of being captured by hunters who supposedly didn't exist in this simulation. Besides, he had more important things to do.</p>
<p>Mertens turned his hands so that the palms were no longer parallel to the table, but vertical like a wall. It immediately stopped in the air before gently lowering itself to the surface of the sea. The soothing sound of the water reached his ears as the waves lapped the shore.</p>
<p>“Stop,” he said calmly.</p>
<p>Immediately the water beneath him froze and the sounds stopped. Another command – “Bye” – plunged the area into darkness. The message appeared before his eyes: “Thank you for visiting Pompeii Archaeological Park.”</p>
<p>He took off his cyber goggles and looked into the expectant faces of Mark Scott and John Baker. They both looked at him eagerly.</p>
<p>“We still need some musical accompaniment to say goodbye,” said Mertens happily, trying not to sound like an excited schoolchild. As CEO, he had to appear professional, even if he was clearly excited about the product. Although he didn't understand every technical detail of what his people were doing, he knew that they had achieved an excellent result.</p>
<p>Mark Scott and John Baker, the two project managers, were still watching him with a mixture of pride and patient reserve. They waited for the next topic. Mertens cleared his throat and changed his tone.</p>
<p>“We financed the Pompeii project from the research funds of the European Union's 8th Framework Program,” he began, casting a questioning look at his colleagues who were listening attentively. “So far, no workshop has taken place with the project partners,” he stated soberly. “We managed to win the Pompeii Archaeological Park. Martina Rossi, an archaeologist - not a specialist, so harmless - and Michael Phillips, who has a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in empirical psychology, but..."</p>
<p>“Phillips was our suggestion,” Mark Scott interrupted. “He developed a psychometric procedure for assessing competence and a model for the empirical determination of dialogue grammars, and received his doctorate with this work. The software agents in the Pompeii project interact according to his model.”</p>
<p>Mertens nodded in agreement. “Right, right. Invite both of you to Milan. I don't want them to interact with the software agents over the Internet - even encrypted and tunneled via VPN. When they do the first workshop, they can end up traveling to Pompeii or a week to Rome." He paused briefly before adding, "We're lucky that we're dealing with an inexperienced archaeologist and a Jesuit with a PhD . “Rossi and Phillips know about the software agents, but don’t let them know about the calculations that run through ARS’s quantum computing interface.”</p>
<p>He looked at Mark and John intently. “Both have experience with EU research projects, but they do not expect groundbreaking innovations. And if something goes wrong – let me know immediately.”</p>
