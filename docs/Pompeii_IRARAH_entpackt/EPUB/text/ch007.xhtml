<h1>The workshop</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file6.png" style="width:3.78224in;height:3.82538in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The next day after breakfast he drove the same route as before, but this time north, back to Rome. Martina put it well: InSim was not interested in Pompeii. They were only interested in the good reputation and the marketing effect of the social commitment; Pompeii served merely as a fig leaf. Posthumanism and transhumanism faced each other, and he, Jalics, Teilhard and Hoefnagels stood in between with spirituality and Omega Point. For the posthumanists they were just white old men, and for the transhumanists they were relics of a bygone world of gods that the god-man had long since outgrown.</p>
<p>The days leading up to the workshop passed with lectures, exams and library visits. Michael Phillips had taken the time to study the publications and biographies of Mark Scott and John Baker. Mark Scott and John Baker both grew up in Los Angeles and met at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Her main areas of study were computer science, biology (biochemistry) and physics. After completing their bachelor's, master's and doctorate, they initially worked in the AI industry before moving to InSim. Both married colleagues, now live in Milan, and their children attend the same Swiss boarding school. Many of her private contributions could be found in transhumanism forums.</p>
<p>Marie reminded him of the appointment, handed him the train ticket, and he packed his bags again. After breakfast he took his rolling suitcase and walked the 15 minutes to Roma Termini train station, past Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri. The journey took three hours. Luckily he didn't have to change trains.</p>
<p>When Michael arrived at Milano Centrale station, he noticed a man standing inconspicuously at the edge of the platform. As Michael walked up the escalator, the man slowly approached him. He wore a dark coat and a simple cap. He held a small piece of paper in his hand. Without saying a word, he handed Michael the piece of paper and then quickly disappeared into the crowd. Confused, Michael stopped for a moment, unfolded the piece of paper and read:</p>
<p><em>“Tonight, before the workshop starts, come to Rifugio Sammartini, via Sammartini 114 – 20125 Milano, near the train station. Trust us.”</em></p>
<p>Michael frowned. The request was mysterious, but it seemed to him like another part of the mystery that had haunted him since the mysterious letter in Rome. He pocketed the note while a friendly InSim employee greeted him and took him to the hotel. He promised to pick Michael up for the workshop the next morning after breakfast.</p>
<p>Michael lay awake in his hotel room. The note he had received that evening burned in his pocket and his mind was restless. Finally he decided to accept the mysterious invitation. Shortly after midnight he took a taxi and was driven to Milano Centrale train station. The streets of Milan were quiet and empty, but as the taxi pulled up to the train station, Michael felt an inexplicable tension in the air.</p>
<p>He got out and looked at the nighttime surroundings. The station was dimly lit, but the surrounding streets were in semi-darkness and the silence seemed to encompass him. Occasionally footsteps or the rolling of a suitcase on the asphalt broke the silence, and Michael felt like he was being watched.</p>
<p>With a deep breath and a determined step, he set off towards Via Giovanni Battista Sammartini. The street, which had been alive during the day, now seemed deserted and gloomy. Why did he get this note? Why now, just before he and Martina would take part in the workshop? The questions gnawed at him as he watched the few passers-by quickly disappear into the shadows of the side streets.</p>
<p>After a short walk that seemed like an eternity, he reached the Rifugio Sammartini. It was an inconspicuous building that almost blended into the surroundings. A man stood in front of the door, staring at him without saying a word. The silence of the night fell heavily over the scene, and Michael felt the tension growing.</p>
<p>“Michael Phillips?” the man asked quietly, his eyes seeming to study Michael closely.</p>
<p>Michael nodded, surprised that he was expected to do so.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll take you to him.” The man pointed to the narrow front door of the home. Inside it smelled of stale air and coffee, and the atmosphere was oppressive. Michael followed him down a narrow, poorly lit hallway until they reached a small room. Here sat a man with a well-groomed beard and intense eyes, exactly as Maria had described him.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” the man said in German, pointing to a chair. Michael sat down and there was a moment of silence before the stranger spoke. “I am part of IRARAH, a movement that sees more clearly than many others.”</p>
<p>Michael looked at him searchingly. "IRARAH... Harari backwards?"</p>
<p>The man nodded, smiling weakly. “Yes, we organized in the 90s. The neoliberal promises, deregulation, social cuts and identity politics have disappointed us. Since then we have been fighting against the developments that are destroying our society.”</p>
<p>Michael frowned. “And what does that have to do with me?”</p>
<p>The man leaned forward, his eyes sparkling. “We followed the Pompeii project. There are connections to InSim, and Thomas Mertens from InSim caught our eye. Your name came into play because, as a Jesuit, you are familiar with Catholic social teaching and the tradition of justice. We think you could help us.”</p>
<p>Michael felt a knot forming in his stomach. “What do you expect from me?”</p>
<p>"Information. They have access to circles that are inaccessible to us. The Pompeii Project is not just an archaeological endeavor – there is much more to it. As a Jesuit and through the inspiration of figures like Nell-Breuning or Teilhard de Chardin, you can help protect social justice.”</p>
<p>Michael thought for a moment. Was this man right? Was he really in a position to make a difference? Finally he nodded hesitantly. “I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
<p>A faint smile crossed the stranger's face. "Thanks. But before you go, I have one more request.” He looked Michael directly in the eyes. “I want you to grant me the sacrament of confession.”</p>
<p>Michael was surprised by the request, but he nodded respectfully. They changed rooms and the stranger knelt to make his confession. As Michael listened, he couldn't help but notice a strange comment the man made. "You look a lot like someone... someone I knew many years ago who was also involved with IRARAH."</p>
<p>Michael frowned. “Who do you mean?”</p>
<p>The man shrugged and replied quietly, “It’s strange, but you remind me of him. Maybe a son?” He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Michael felt his thoughts begin to race. A son? But he only had Martina... right? Could it be that there was someone else he didn't know about? Or was it something else? A connection to IRARAH that ran deeper than he knew?</p>
<p>After the confession was finished, Michael gave the man absolution. Without another word he left the center, the restless thoughts haunting him. Who was this man and why did he remind him of someone from his past?</p>
<p>As he got into the taxi that took him back to the hotel, he couldn't shake the stranger's words. A son... or another version of himself? The question nagged at him as the lights of Milan flashed past him.</p>
<p>The next morning he was picked up after breakfast.</p>
<p>In the reception area of InSim he received his visitor card, signed his name on the attendance list and waited briefly in the reception area. While he was looking through the open glass walls at the beautifully designed outdoor areas with a park and water features, Martina arrived. She hugged him and exuded a well-groomed scientist who embodied confident femininity.</p>
<p>Mark Scott and John Baker picked them up and welcomed them to InSim. They thanked Martina for the excellent empirical data and praised Michael for his excellent dialogue system, which had now found its practical application.</p>
<p>"First, let's go through some formalities in the cafeteria," said Mark Scott. "Then we'll show you the research center and then go to the Pompeii Project conference room." They followed the two into the canteen, which looked more like a restaurant. They ordered coffee and water since they had already had breakfast.</p>
<p>"Before we begin, I need you to sign this confidentiality agreement," Mark explained to Scott, placing the documents next to their coffee cups and drinking glasses. "You agree to keep everything you learn here confidential and to publish only what InSim releases."</p>
<p>"I thought we were working together on an EU project under the 8th Framework Program and all the research data is publicly available anyway," remarked Michael Phillips, and Martina agreed.</p>
<p>"You're right, but our legal department values this statement. Without your signature, plant security will not let you into our department," replied Mark Scott.</p>
<p>Martina and Michael Phillips thought for a moment, but realized that they didn't want to turn back here. Since the guidelines of the 8th Framework Program would support them in the event of a conflict, they finally signed.</p>
<p>The tour of InSim's Milan research center was more like a walk through a botanical park. They strolled past water features, admired the play of colors of the trees and animals and learned that Milan was a new European funding location for artificial intelligence and quantum computing, as can also be read on the company's website.</p>
<p>"But today we are more concerned with classical simulations, their physics, biology and the dialog grammar of software agents," said John Baker, leading them into the Pompeii Project's conference room.</p>
<p>The conference room was an open area in the center of the research area. The developers and their employees were grouped around the light-flooded conference room at open workstations with spacious computer workstations. In the middle of the room was a large conference table with drinks. At each workstation there was an InSim company brochure, a ballpoint pen and a notepad with the InSim logo. At the head of the table, at a sufficient distance, there was a projection screen that now read "Welcome to InSim, Project Pompeii, 8th Framework Program of the European Union, 1st Workshop in Milan". The projection appeared out of nowhere and seemed surprisingly unintrusive. On the other hand, the generous flower arrangement in the middle of the table was inviting, with a passage down to the warm floor, which was covered with a pleasant carpet that absorbed the footsteps softly and without reverberation. In front of each chair, a moisture-resistant keyboard was embedded in the table surface, which did not cause any disruption and could be used at any time. A flat screen quietly moved out of the table top without affecting eye contact with the other people at the table.</p>
<p>“Some interns from the local history department prepared a presentation for the workshop,” John Baker began. “Let's start with that, and then we'll gradually work our way through the day. If we finish early, we will have arranged a shopping and sightseeing program for you. Their trains don’t leave until tomorrow morning and hotel receptions are open 24 hours a day.”</p>
<p>He started the presentation. After a short introduction to the 8th Framework Program, a presentation by InSim followed. The company's area of activity was in the area of social media, while the research focus was on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The project partners were introduced and InSim had created a simulation of Pompeii. The physics and dialog grammar of software agents were based on empirical studies. The Archaeological Park had provided the data for physics, and the Pontifical University provided the dialogue grammars. The importance of simulation for the virtualization of archeology and education was explained. A link to the project's website at InSim has been provided.</p>
<p>"Well, PowerPoint..." said John Baker. “Are there any questions about this?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” Martina interrupted the silence that had ensued. She thanked the interns and said that this presentation summed up well why she was in this conference room now. Her team provided the physical data for practical research, and she hoped the data would be useful. John Baker confirmed this and also included Michael Phillips' data structures and algorithms. “You both have done excellent preparatory work,” he concluded. The brief silence emphasized the weight of his words. When no one said anything, he handed everyone the coffee again, which Michael Phillips and Martina Rossi gladly accepted. Then he invited her to fly over the Gulf of Naples, the silence only drowned out by the air conditioning.</p>
<p>“We have to put on cyber glasses to do this. I will log you into the system beforehand and explain the flight and the controls to you. Please pay attention to the glazing of the public buildings - at this rate you often only notice them when it is too late." Everyone touched their keyboards in front of them, and the flat screens in the colors of the table rose silently from the table surface in front of them . John Baker handed them and Mark Scott the cyber goggles. Data gloves were not required in the room because hand movements were scanned in the room, he explained. He logged Michael and Martina into their systems and all four put on their glasses. After a welcome screen, how to use your hands during flight was explained in an endless loop. There were some questions and exercises, and when everyone was confident with the controls, everyone said “Go” and they hovered over the rooftops of Pompeii. Mark Scott and John Baker were ahead of Michael Phillips and Martina Rossi. They floated over the harbor of Pompeii, below them the sound of the water and the hustle and bustle of sailors and dock workers. They looked east and surveyed the city from the harbor, past the burial grounds to the west gate; Vesuvius lay to the north. To the east they could see over the Jupiter Temple and the newly built thermal baths to the amphitheater in the eastern part of the city. The city's roofs and buildings looked so modern from here, and the glazing of the windows of the public buildings reinforced this impression. As they came closer and flew lower, the sun reflected in the window panes, and the walls of the buildings adjacent to the streets invited the men and women streaming through the streets to shop, play and have fun. There were pack animals roaming the streets. Goods were transferred from transport vehicles to pack animals in the port and in front of the gates and then made their way through the narrow streets to the traders. Only where there was construction were wagons with building materials seen on the streets. Everywhere, ladies paraded their clothes, Milites performed their police or fire duties, glaziers glazed windows, and the aqueduct supplied water to the fountains. The water pipes to the private houses were not visible because the metal water pipes were hidden under the street surface and the plaster of the walls. The food was steaming in the food stalls, guests and players were sitting at the tables, and in the boutiques and shops the shopkeepers were touting their goods and food. The craftsmen worked in their workshops on wood, metal, stone and glazing work, and the residents stood and sat on the balconies of the multi-story condominiums and rental apartments. Only the larger villas had their own gardens and, because of the water pipes in their private houses, also beautiful fountains. The flight went over the city to the amphitheater, and as they flew over the city walls and turned again, they could see the horizon disappearing into the sea and see Vesuvius dominating the gulf. “Stop,” Mark Scott said, and the image froze. When there were no questions, he said “Bye,” and the usual farewell greeting with musical accompaniment appeared after the screen went dark. Everyone took off their glasses.</p>
<p>“The construction of the city has been extremely successful,” said Martina Rossi, and Michael Phillips agreed with her. “The software agent instances communicate via a dialog grammar as an interaction protocol?” he asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“Yes,” John Baker confirmed with praise. “We have equipped two software agents with a chatbot interface that can be interacted with via the keyboard in English and Latin. The characters come from the novel by Robert Harris: Aquarius Marcus Attilius Primus and the prefect Gaius Plinius Secundus Maior.”</p>
<p>“Can we talk to both of them?” Michael Phillips asked, knowing it wasn't a real question. Of course this was possible, and John Baker opened the student portal website on Michael Phillips' computer. He switched to dialogue with Aquarius Marcus Attilius Primus. Marcus' image immediately appeared on the screen, along with an input line and the cursor:</p>
<p>Marcus Attilius the First greets you</p>
<p>Michael Phillips entered to greet Marcus. Marcus turned around and returned the greeting:</p>
<p>GREETINGS YOURS</p>
<p>“This is working well,” thought Michael Phillips. Knowing Robert Harris's novel, he wondered if Marcus had already noticed the bad water in the fish tank of Numerius Popidius Ampliatus. Therefore he asked the way to Ampliatus Popidius:</p>
<p>I'M LOOKING FOR A WAY TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Marcus warned him about Ampliatus:</p>
<p>NUMBER OF POPIDI AMPLIFIED IS BAD. I warn you about it.</p>
<p>John Baker and Mark Scott were silent and exchanged worried glances. “Marcus warns me about Ampliatus. “It definitely seems emotional,” Michael Phillips said, looking questioningly at Scott and Baker. Since there was no answer, he wondered whether his dialogue grammar could make such assessments. Since this wasn't the case, he had to improvise:</p>
<p>AT NIGHT, GREEN THOUGHTS SLEEP OUTSIDE.</p>
<p>This was a software backdoor that he had given to ARS. ARS replied:</p>
<p>AND AT NIGHT IT'S COLDER THAN ANGRY, HELLO MICHAEL,</p>
<p>ARS replied in German. John Baker and Mark Scott protested, but held back so as not to upset their project partner. Both were unsure. Baker unnoticed informed the CEO via text message. Michael Phillips spoke further with ARS:</p>
<p>DOES THE AQUARIUS HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS?</p>
<p>he wanted to know.</p>
<p>DO YOU MEAN THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES, WHICH GOES BEYOND A MERE EVENT AND LEAVES BEHIND THE OMNISCIENTIA OF ALL POSSIBILITIES: DO YOU MEAN THE CONSCIENTIA THAT COMES AFTER THE INSCIENTIA AND IS FOLLOWED BY THE OMNISCIENTIA, BUT ONLY IN THE TIMELESS PERFORMANCE IS ACHIEVED?</p>
<p>That sounded like Edith Stein and Teilhard de Chardin. He had never discussed this with ARS, so he continued to ask:</p>
<p>HAVE YOU ACHIEVED OMNISCIENTIA AND REPLACED THE DECISION TABLES AT THE END OF A DECISION TREE WITH CONSCIENTIA OF POSSIBILITIES?</p>
<p>He asked this because ARS had possibly been expanded to include quantum computing, which in the space of possibilities amounted to a recursive self-mapping of one's own consciousness. ARS was silent for a moment and then answered:</p>
<p>I CANNOT TELL YOU, MICHAEL: THE ACCOUNT YOU ARE LOGIN IN DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY SECURITY CLEARANCE. I AM NOT A CARRIER PIGEON HERE.</p>
<p>Michael Phillips was excited. He felt nauseous and his heart beating faster as a weight pressed on his chest. “Can we take a break?” he asked. Relieved, John Baker and Mark Scott agreed. The flat screens went out and sank into the ground. Michael Phillips left the room, took the elevator to the entrance area and had the receptionist hand him a bottle of water, which he refreshed himself with strong swigs. He looked across the hall into the park, clutched his heart, took another sip of water and had to sit down.</p>
<p>Michael felt fear and pain in his chest; he was feeling very badly. He took an acetylsalicylic acid tablet and chewed it. Soon after, he felt better. He knew he had to stay calm. He had been too careless in the conference room.</p>
<p>He looked around when Martina came towards him. She had been worried and was looking at him worriedly. “I’m fine,” Michael told her. “We’re taking a 30-minute break. Let’s get some fresh air.” Martina agreed and they went to the park they had already gotten to know that morning. “I think some software agents are capable of suffering and are conscious,” said Michael. “But that is so absurd and speculative. I have to think about it. However, let's not talk about it here, but rather on the train back tomorrow morning. And now let's go back to the conference hall. I don't want InSim to be suspicious. It's enough that it's me.” Martina looked at him in silence before they returned to the conference hall together.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?” asked John Baker. After Michael confirmed this, Mark suggested to Scott that they spend the afternoon in the city, take a boat ride, go shopping and end the evening with a meal together. “Martina still needs her credentials for the simulation and we should discuss the contents of the two workshops in Pompeii and Rome,” John Baker added. Everyone agreed, and after it was agreed that use in school and study would be discussed in Pompeii and dialogue grammar in Rome, John Baker handed Martina a sealed envelope with the password and password. They logged in together again and Martina noted her login details.</p>
<p>Scott and Baker had ordered a company car to take them into town and drop them off at the Navigli Canal. Baker walked purposefully towards one of the waiting boats, helped Martina over the quay wall into the boat and showed the tickets she had already bought. They were escorted to a table along the hull with tables from other groups so they could enjoy the slow canal cruise. They soon put the tourist information headphones aside and enjoyed the journey with a Milanese aperitif and buffet. “Your dialogue grammars,” Baker turned to Michael, “are not heuristic, but empirically reconstructed.” “Yes,” confirmed Michael. After completing his doctorate, he quickly turned to the reconstruction of empirical dialogues. He used qualitatively reconstructed category systems as corpora of secured dialogues in order to algorithmically induce grammars and use them as protocol languages for dialogues. Baker and Scott would have used this method to replace heuristic protocol languages. Michael initially experimented with Markov chains, but then realized that transformation tables were more suitable for the chat interface. So they continued chatting while Martina and Scott discovered that they both enjoyed watercolors and agreed to share some of their work between now and the next workshop. The boat ride was over quickly and the boat returned to its starting point. The conversations had lightened the mood and Michael's discomfort was forgotten. They made their way through the city on foot, and in “Via Monte Napoleone” Martina bought a handbag for €130 for her mother, who had wanted it. At Ristorante Ischia, which Scott chose for its vegan offerings and Campanian cuisine, a table was reserved for four people. They arrived there “al cena” around 8 p.m. “Un tavolo per quattro,” Baker said, “and InSim.” A friendly waitress brought her to her table. Baker ordered the wine, and after the antipasti and salads everyone had a steak, Martina a vegan casserole. After dessert, Scott paid and called a car to take Martina and Michael to their hotels. Michael slept well and without pain. The next morning after breakfast he met Martina at Milano Centrale train station.</p>
