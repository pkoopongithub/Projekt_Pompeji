<h1>Prologue â€“ The beginning of a new era</h1>

<p>Hidden from the public, Thomas Mertens, CEO of InSim, together with other actors from the information technology-financial complex, dominated the global development of the new digital economy. His company's advances in quantum computing and artificial intelligence would surpass and leave humans behind - that was his belief. He firmly believed that the future lay beyond human existence.</p>
<p>InSim, a global company, had created a revolutionary simulation of the ancient city of Pompeii. But the software was used for more than just archaeological research. The software agents that lived in this simulation were programmed to recreate human dialogues, make decisions and meet the challenges of an artificially created world. But what the partners in the EU project didn't know: These agents were supposed to help InSim expand the boundaries of quantum computing. The goal was to develop AI systems with the ability to self-reflect and be aware.</p>
<p>Posthumanism collided with transhumanism when two of these software agents and an AI unexpectedly sought church asylum in Vatican City. What began as mere data structures in the technical world had morphed into a philosophical and moral crisis.</p>
<p>At the center of this development was Michael Phillips, a theologian with a fascination for the big questions of evolution and the human spirit. Phillips was certain that humanity was on the threshold of a new metaphysical dimension - a point that the Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin called the Omega Point. A point where technology and humanity, mind and matter, could converge. But was humanity willing to share the Omega Point with an AI?</p>
<p>The world still had no idea of the revolution that was taking place in the background. But the coming events would show that the path to self-transcendence was open not only to humans but also to machines.</p>
