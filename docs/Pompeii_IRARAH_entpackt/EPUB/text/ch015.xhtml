<h1>Escape from Pompeii</h1>

<p>The tension in the car was palpable, the silence oppressive. Martina felt the danger hovering over them like an invisible cloud. The man who looked like Michael kept his eyes on the road, focused, calm. But suddenly they noticed another vehicle in the rearview mirror that was quickly approaching them.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” said young Michael calmly but firmly as he turned the wheel and tried to shake off his pursuer. The car behind them was getting closer and closer, trying to force them off the road. They were harassed several times, but Michael maneuvered skillfully and remained calm. Eventually the pursuer lost control and crashed into the guard rails.</p>
<p>Martina breathed a sigh of relief while young Michael remained focused. "We don't have much time," he said firmly. “There is a small airport nearby. We’ll get you to safety there.”</p>
<p>As they drove through the nighttime streets, Martina couldn't let the thought of the mysterious young man go. Who was he? Finally she couldn't stand it anymore and turned to Julia, who was sitting silently next to her.</p>
<p>“Mom, I have to tell you something,” Martina began quietly. “I already saw him in the simulation.” Julia gave her an astonished look. "He looked just like Dad, but he's...younger."</p>
<p>Julia stared at her in confusion. "What do you think? Do you think he is...?”</p>
<p>Martina hesitated, her thoughts racing. “I don't know exactly. But he said something... He said that in another reality he might be able to..." She trailed off, her words hanging heavy in the room.</p>
<p>Julia shook her head in disbelief. “Parallel worlds? Do you really think that could be true?”</p>
<p>"I don't know, but it explains the similarity, doesn't it?" Martina clung to that idea because it was the only explanation that seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>Julia closed her eyes for a moment, as if trying to understand the situation. Then she looked at Martina, and her voice was quiet but piercing: “What if he’s not a parallel version at all? What if he’s… a son of your father that we don’t know about?”</p>
<p>Martina was speechless. An unknown son? The idea seemed even more unreal to her than that of a parallel world. But Julia's words had awakened something within her - a possibility she couldn't ignore.</p>
