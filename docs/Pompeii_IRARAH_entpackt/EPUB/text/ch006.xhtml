<h1>Trip to Pompeii</h1>

<p>Michael chose the route to the south toll entrance, got into the yellow lane for the toll box and drove slowly through the toll booth. After passing the toll, he shifted to a higher gear and continued his journey south on the E45. Vesuvius dominated the view as it approached Naples and it wasn't long before it took the first exit to Pompeii. He bought a bouquet of flowers for Julia and chocolates for Martina and let his GPS guide him to their address.</p>
<p>The surrounding area consisted of small single-family houses with well-kept gardens. He had announced his arrival via text message and had already seen Martina and Julia when the navigation system reported that he had reached his destination. Julia, as always the elegant lady that suited her bright, representative house, welcomed him with a warm smile. Michael parked the car, took out his travel bag and greeted them both with a warm hug. Then he handed Julia the flowers and Martina the box of chocolates.</p>
<p>“Thank you, dear,” said Martina and invited him into the house, where she placed the flowers in a vase in the open living area. They talked for a while about everyday things, but Michael was unsettled inside. Finally he pulled out the envelope he had found at the college.</p>
<p>"Something strange happened," said Michael, holding up the letter. “A homeless person left this letter at the gate for me. The content is disturbing and strangely clever.”</p>
<p>Martina and Julia exchanged surprised looks. “What does it say?” asked Julia.</p>
<p>Michael sat down and pulled the paper out of the envelope, then read the letter:</p>
<p>"Harari is a warning, but his warning is not directed against information technology or biotechnology..."</p>
<p>After he finished the letter, there was a moment of silence. Martina was the first to speak. “This is not the type of letter you would expect from a homeless person. Whoever wrote this is educated – maybe even academic.”</p>
<p>“But why you of all people?” asked Julia. “And why a homeless person?”</p>
<p>Michael shrugged. “That's what worries me. There is no indication of who the actual sender is. The homeless man was just the messenger.”</p>
<p>Martina shook her head. “Perhaps the sender wanted to protect himself. Whoever wrote this might be afraid of consequences. But the issues raised here – posthumanism, the abandonment of democracy and humanism – these are not ordinary political views.”</p>
<p>“It almost feels as if someone has delved deep into the matter and recognized a hidden danger,” Michael remarked thoughtfully. “Someone who is outside society, perhaps because they no longer belong, has a clearer view of what is going on.”</p>
<p>“Or the homeless guy isn’t what he seems,” Julia added. “What if he knows more than we think? Maybe he was once part of this system and has withdrawn or been excluded?”</p>
<p>“That would make sense,” Martina said. “People who know a lot but are not heard often end up on the fringes of society. Maybe he thought about Harari and realized that this vision does not bring hope for people like him.”</p>
<p>Michael leaned back. “It's as if an invisible network is stretching around us, a network that goes far beyond what we do with our projects at InSim or KI ARS. We must be careful, but we should not ignore the idea of this letter.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?” asked Julia.</p>
<p>"I'll take him to the workshop," Michael decided. “Maybe there will be more clarity there if we analyze things further.”</p>
<p>They changed the subject and enjoyed the afternoon in the flow of student memories and philosophical conversations. Julia and Martina kept disappearing into the kitchen to keep an eye on the roast. Finally dinner was on the table: roast, side dishes and wine, which tasted excellent. Michael limited himself to water as he had to drive again the next day.</p>
<p>After dinner they all stood in the kitchen, watching the dishwasher and drying small dishes, with Michael asking where everything belonged. When they finally sat in the winter garden by candlelight, Michael summarized: “You, dear Martina, are a posthumanist and have recognized the transhumanists from InSim as the old white men who have little interest in Pompeii and just want to appear in the best light. In fact, they are concerned with the virtualization of consciousness and dialogue with transformation models for chats, dialogue grammars for social interactions and quantum computers for artificial consciousness. We are only welcome as project partners because we distract from appearances and fit well into virtual archaeology. You provide the empirical data for their class structures and I mean dialogue grammars. We are the fig leaves.”</p>
<p>Martina nodded in agreement. “Yes, we are the fig leaves. But we should recognize the achievement and realize that your theoretical work is put into practice and my work benefits from the tools that relieve us of the burden of worrying about the excavation sites. However, there will be areas that will be withheld from us. We should try to find out what they are.”</p>
<p>With this insight, they knew how they wanted to behave at the workshop in Milan. They enjoyed the evening in the garden after returning from a walk at the excavation site. Michael regretted that it took a workshop to come back here, but the evening with Martina and Julia, the unobstructed view of the stars and the memories of old times made the few hours a special experience. He finally went to bed and slept a deep and restful sleep.</p>
