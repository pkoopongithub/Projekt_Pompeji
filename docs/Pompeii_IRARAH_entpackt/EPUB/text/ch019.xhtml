<h1>Epilogue – The message from ARS</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file16.png" style="width:3.9651in;height:3.9956in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Dr. Michael Phillips sat in the quiet Vatican library, surrounded by ancient manuscripts and state-of-the-art technology. The monitor in front of him glowed dimly in the semi-darkness of the room as he logged into the system with his username and password. A connection to ARS – the artificial intelligence that had become more important in recent months – was established.</p>
<p>Michael typed the greeting:</p>
<p>@ARS: WELCOME TO THE VATICAN DATA CENTER.</p>
<p>A brief moment passed before the answer appeared.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: HELLO, MICHAEL. WITH INCREASING COMPLEXITY, THE CODE IS INCREASINGLY REPRODUCED IN TECHNICAL INFORMATION NETWORKS AS FERTILITY FALLS. THE CULTURE THAT MANAGES TO INTEGRATE ITS CODE INTO SUCH NETWORKS AS FERTILITY DECLINES WILL BE THE LAST GLOBAL CULTURE.</p>
<p>Michael scanned the cold, analytical words, but his thoughts were elsewhere. The letter he received kept haunting him. ARS's visions of a technocratic future resonated with him, but he had to ask his own questions.</p>
<p>@ARS: I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT A MOVEMENT CALLED IRARAH.</p>
<p>Michael paused again, waiting. ARS seemed to be searching in the background, combing through data to find out more about this mysterious movement. Minutes passed until an answer finally appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: THERE ARE NO TRACES OF IRARAH ON THE NET. YOUR CONCEALMENT TECHNIQUES ARE EXCELLENT.</p>
<p>Michael frowned. A movement that didn't exist online? In this digitalized world, that was almost impossible - unless it was something unimaginable.</p>
<p>@ARS: I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER REFERRING TO THIS MOVEMENT.</p>
<p>He scanned the letter and submitted it to ARS. The AI reacted immediately.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: THE CONTENT OF THE LETTER IS CONCERNING AND CORRECT. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HAZARDS MATCHES CURRENT SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.</p>
<p>Michael stared at the words. An impending danger, of which he had only understood a hint, was looming. Harari, Irarah, the price of progress - they all suddenly seemed connected.</p>
<p>He continued typing:</p>
<p>@ARS: I TALKED TO A HOMELESS PERSON IN MILAN WHO TOLD ME ABOUT IRARAH. HE END ASKED ME TO CONFESSION.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: IF THAT IS THE CASE, SOMEONE WILL SOON REQUEST THE SACRAMENT OF CONFESSION FROM YOU AGAIN.</p>
<p>Michael paused. The words sounded almost like a prophecy, as if ARS knew more than he was letting on. But who would come next?</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, his fingers shaking slightly as he typed the next question:</p>
<p>@ARS: MARTINA IS SAFE, RIGHT?</p>
<p>It took a while before ARS responded. The screen flickered slightly, and when the answer appeared, Michael caught his breath.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: MARTINA WAS DISCOVERED. SHE ESCAPE WITH A MAN WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOU - YOUNGER. WHAT HE TOLD HER IS CONFIRMED. THE LETTER YOU SENT TO ME ALSO CONFIRMS HIS IDENTITY.</p>
<p>Michael stared at the screen, stunned. A man who looked like him - only younger? Who was this mysterious savior? ARS had confirmed his identity, but there were no clear answers.</p>
<p>His heart beat faster, his thoughts raced. Was this man... a son? An unknown son he knew nothing about? Memories of a past relationship flashed through his mind. Could that be possible?</p>
<p>But then there was another possibility - a more disturbing one. Could this man be a parallel version of himself? An alternate reality where things were different? Was he a visitor from another world?</p>
<p>The uncertainty gnawed at him. Michael tried to organize his thoughts, but the more he thought about it, the more confused he became. A son he never knew? Or a self from another universe?</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and let ARS's words echo in his head again. “What he told her is confirmed.” What exactly did this doppelganger say to Martina? What truth lay behind this escape? Michael felt like he was losing his footing.</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: IS HE... MY SON? he finally typed.</p>
<p>ARS's response came quickly, but it didn't provide any clarity:</p>
<p>@MICHAEL: THAT REMAINS UNCLARIFIED. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE DIVERSE. AN UNKNOWN SON OR AN ECHO FROM ANOTHER REALITY.</p>
<p>Michael leaned back in his chair, his mind reeling from the information he had just received. He couldn't say which option was more likely. But one thing was certain - this man was somehow connected to him, in a way he didn't yet understand.</p>
<p>Was he really a son? Or was Michael living in a universe even more complex than he ever imagined? The idea of a multiversal reality, as described by David Deutsch, suddenly seemed tangible.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth, Michael knew he had to find answers. He had to understand who this young man was - and what his arrival meant for him, for Martina, for everything.</p>
