<h1>Arrival at the airport</h1>

<p>Finally they reached the small, almost deserted airport. A private plane stood by, its turbines humming quietly. Vesuvius rose darkly on the horizon and the night lay like a heavy veil over the landscape. Young Michael silently led them to the plane without further explanation.</p>
<p>“Who is he really?” Julia suddenly asked as they entered the plane. Her voice was searching, almost accusatory. “Why does he look like Michael?”</p>
<p>Young Michael turned to her, his face in the partial shadow of the fuselage. "It doesn't matter now," he said calmly, but his eyes seemed to be hiding something. “The most important thing is that you are safe.”</p>
<p>Julia wanted to ask more questions, but Martina gently held her arm. It wasn't the time to look for answers. They knew they had to escape first.</p>
