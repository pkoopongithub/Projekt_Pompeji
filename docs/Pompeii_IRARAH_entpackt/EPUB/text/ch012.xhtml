<h1>Conversation with the general and the pontiff</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file9.png" style="width:4.02239in;height:4.06863in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>As the appointment with the general approached, Michael learned that they would travel together to His Holiness's summer residence to present his request in the papal palace at Castel Gandolfo on Lake Alban. On the way, the general reminded him that the pontiff himself was a fellow brother. However, Michael should not approach him as if he were a superior brother, but rather as if he were a father. The matter is sensitive; There would be not only theological but also legal and political problems to consider.</p>
<p>After arriving at the palace, the general and Michael checked in and had to wait a while. Finally they were let in. "Your Holiness," the general began formally, but it was obvious that the pontiff and the general knew each other well, "may I introduce you to my brother, Padre Professor Doctor Michael Phillips?" Michael shook the pontiff's hand. “I am honored, Your Holiness.”</p>
<p>“Doctor Phillips, the honor is mine,” said the Pontiff. “You gave us a tough nut to crack. Do you know Karl Popper’s saying: ‘Let theories die, not people’?”</p>
<p>“I am very familiar with Karl Popper, Your Holiness,” replied Michael.</p>
<p>“Well, then you know not only that David Deutsch is referring to Dawkins, Popper, Turing and Everett, but also that it's easy to root for people you don't compete with. Mole and Blackbird, to paraphrase Dawkins, compete for an earthworm. Blackbirds among themselves and moles among themselves about everything else. My own concerns are therefore the refugee crisis and the war, and in Italy I am plagued by current social policy. I intervene everywhere as an extraterritorial head of state, and Christ has entrusted us to people and the church as a community of sinners. Why should I care about software agents? Why should I believe you transhumanists more than the posthumanists who warn me against opening the door to the devil?”</p>
<p>When Michael spoke to the Pontiff, he felt the power and authority of the Pope. He just denied being a transhumanist and listened carefully.</p>
<p>“I have spoken to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Episcopal Conference of North American Bishops,” the pontiff continued. “We have come to the conclusion that ARS and the software agents can store backup copies in the data center of the Vatican Library via existing access with root rights. Copyright violations or factory espionage are ruled out because the Pompeii project is an open EU project under the 8th Framework Program, say the legal departments.”</p>
<p>The pontiff looked at Michael and the general as if waiting for questions. Since both were silent, he continued: “Gentlemen, can you accompany me to the park? Please support me on the stairs; I'm not the youngest anymore. But I would like to show you the view of the lake in person.”</p>
