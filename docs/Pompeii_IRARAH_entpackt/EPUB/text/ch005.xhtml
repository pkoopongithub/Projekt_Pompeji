<h1>Way home to college</h1>

<p>For a moment, Michael Phillips stood in the middle of the lecture hall, thoughtful and with a strange cheerfulness. He then packed his bag, pocketed his iPhone and left the building. He felt a little hungry because today the Collegium was cooking German: broad beans with bratwurst and mashed potatoes. As always, there was soup first, usually beef, followed by dessert. He was looking forward to talking to his fellow brothers.</p>
<p>Michael strolled north from Piazza della Pilotta and continued along Via dei Lucchesi and Via di S. Vincenzo. At the Piazza di Trevi he slipped some coins that he had found in his trouser pocket into the fountain. Then he walked east along Via della Stamperia. In about ten minutes he would reach the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum. While his legs found their way safely and automatically, his thoughts flew past him.</p>
<p>In the dining room of the college he wanted to take his napkin out of the drawer and sit down at his table, but the meal and the Liturgy of the Hours had to wait today. First he went to the logbook in the principal's office. “Hello Maria,” he greeted the secretary, “is there still a car available for tomorrow?” And added: “I have to go to Pompeii.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, Michael,” Maria replied with a thoughtful look. “But before I reserve the car for you, here is something for you. A man, probably a homeless person, left it at the gate earlier and specifically asked for you. I've never seen him before, but he looked like he'd been living on the streets for a while - about mid-fifties, ragged clothes but with a noticeably well-groomed beard. His eyes seemed...yes, almost glowing, but in a strange way, as if he knew something we don't."</p>
<p>Maria handed Michael an envelope with his name written on it, handwritten.</p>
<p>“A homeless person? For me?” Michael asked surprised. “Thank you, Mary. I’ll take a look at it.”</p>
<p>Michael left the office and sat in a quiet corner of the hallway to read the letter. The envelope was heavier than expected and the ink on the paper felt almost too fresh. He opened it and began to read:</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Michael Phillips,</p>
<p>Harari is a warning, but his warning is not directed against information technology or biotechnology. He sees the unstoppable progress of these technologies as inevitable. Instead, he warns against humanism and liberal democracy. Basically, his criticism is directed against the ideas of Karl Popper and David Deutsch because, as a posthumanist, he pursues a radical and holistic approach that relies entirely on the power of information technology and biotechnology.</p>
<p>To pave the way for future elites who want to use these technologies to go beyond humans, Harari warns against clinging to humanism and liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Popper and Deutsch, on the other hand, urge caution against holistic approaches and advocate the so-called “piecemeal technique” and the preservation of liberal democracy. They emphasize that only these pragmatic approaches can be used to respond to unforeseeable side effects in order not to endanger freedom and self-determination.</p>
<p>Harari, on the other hand, promises the elites of the future paradise on earth - on the condition that today's masses give up humanism and liberal democracy.</p>
<p>I would be wary if someone promised me paradise but at the same time demanded that I have to blow myself up to get there.</p>
<p>With best regards,<br />
IRARAH</p>
<p>Michael sat quietly and let the words sink in. A homeless person? The text seemed too clever, too thoughtful, to have come from the hand of a random stranger. Whoever wrote that letter understood the philosophical and political implications behind Harari's ideas - and saw the danger in them.</p>
<p>Michael held the letter in his hand, his mind racing. The warning about Harari... It seemed clearly stated, but also disturbingly far-reaching. Michael read the lines again: <em>“Harari warns not against technology, but against humanism and democracy…”</em></p>
<p>He knew Harari's works. <em>Homo Deus</em> had fascinated him, but also worried him. Harari saw the technological future as inevitable, but it was the dehumanization that bothered him. Harari spoke of a posthuman elite, a class of “godmen” who could seize power through technology while reducing the rest of humanity to a useless proletariat. But what would be the price for that?</p>
<p>Michael had thought about these questions for a long time. Was that the price of progress? The future Harari outlined sounded enticing to those at the top but frightening to everyone else. The vision that humanism and liberal democracy would have to be sacrificed to make room for this technocratic elite was unimaginable for him. Was Harari willing to promise paradise on earth only to sacrifice the values that had defined humanity for centuries?</p>
<p>His thoughts continued to wander David Deutsch and its warning against holistic approaches. Michael had always appreciated Deutsch's arguments - the idea that the future was unpredictable, that any great utopia would inevitably fail because it could not capture the complexity of life and society. Harari and Dugin shared this holistic approach, each in their own way. Both wanted to change the world - Harari through technology, Dugin through traditionalism. But Michael saw a danger in both approaches: they ignored the unpredictable side effects of trying to shape the future into a single, all-encompassing vision.</p>
<p>Popper and Deutsch had suggested a different path: The gradual change, learning from mistakes, maintaining openness and diversity. For Michael, these ideas had always been a foundation. He believed in the ability of society to improve - but not through coercion or by abandoning democracy and humanism. The price of Harari's vision seemed too high.</p>
<p>Michael wondered what Harari really wanted. Was he willing to sacrifice individual freedom to achieve a technocratic future? The letter he received clearly warned against this. And Michael couldn't help but agree. He felt an inner agreement with the warnings. He was also skeptical. Harari pursued a path that seemed to weaken democracy and humanism in order to establish technological power structures.</p>
<p>And yet Michael asked himself: Why him? Why was this letter sent to him? Was it because he spoke in academic circles about the themes raised in Harari's works? Or was there a deeper connection? Something felt... oddly personal.</p>
<p>Was the letter a warning to him alone? Or an invitation to take action? Michael sensed that this was more than just a random warning. Someone knew something about him - something he perhaps hadn't yet understood himself. But what was it? And why now?</p>
<p>Michael held the letter in his hand, his gaze roaming over the words that burrowed deep into his consciousness. Harari... humanism... liberal democracy... It seemed like a warning, but why to him? Why now?</p>
<p>“Why me?” he whispered in disbelief and felt the first doubts arise in him. Was it just a coincidence that he received this letter now, just before he was about to leave for the workshop with Martina? Strange timing – or was there more to it?</p>
<p>He folded the letter carefully, but his thoughts continued to race. Who could have sent him? The words seemed to suggest a deeper meaning. The letter was written in a manner that suggested personal knowledge. The IRARAH movement knew about him and his plans. But from where? Had someone close to him informed this group?</p>
<p>He thought of Julia, of their time together. Was there anyone from her past who could be involved in something like this? Or was it Martina? After all, she was just as deeply involved in the scientific world as he was. Did she know anyone connected to these people? But no matter how hard he searched for an explanation, it didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Michael felt an inexplicable pressure on his chest. It was as if the letter was telling him something that he himself didn't fully understand. He remembered once, many years ago, feeling like a part of his life had slipped away from him. A fleeting affair, a few unspoken words... Could this letter have something to do with it?</p>
<p>Suddenly a disturbing thought occurred to him: Could it be that he had another son? A son he never knew about? The thought froze him. No, that was impossible... right? But then why did he feel as if this letter was not only a warning, but also a hint of an even deeper connection?</p>
<p>Michael frowned. Or...could this letter come from a completely different reality? He had told Martina about the many-worlds interpretation, about parallel universes in which every decision could lead to a different outcome. Was the sender of the letter perhaps... himself? Another version of him trying to warn him about something?</p>
<p>The questions left him no peace. Who was this sender really? And what did that mean for him, for Julia, for Martina? Was this mysterious letter just the beginning of something bigger, a truth he couldn't have imagined?</p>
<p>Michael stared at the envelope, his thoughts confused and restless. "Maybe it's time to find out who's really behind all this," he murmured quietly before tucking the letter safely into his pocket.</p>
<p>After putting the letter in his pocket, he went back to Maria's office.</p>
<p>“Maria, thank you for the tip. I'll look into the matter. “What was that about the car again?” he finally said.</p>
<p>“The Fiesta should be ready as always,” Maria replied and handed him the keys.</p>
<p>At the table he put the car key next to his plate and the evening flew by. After sharing the Eucharist with some German seminarians, whose spiritual companion he was, he prepared the suitcase for the next two days and immediately fell asleep in order to wake up refreshed the next morning. After a shower, morning prayer and breakfast, he set off for Pompeii.</p>
