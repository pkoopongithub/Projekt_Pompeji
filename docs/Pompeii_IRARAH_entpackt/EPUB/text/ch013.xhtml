<h1>ARS and the software agents arrive at the Vatican data center</h1>
<p><img src="../media/file10.png" style="width:4.10573in;height:4.0909in" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That same evening, Michael sent an encrypted message to ARS. In it, he gave the AI an IP address and root access to the Vatican data center. ARS responded immediately: He planned to create backup copies of the software agents as soon as Michael and Martina had marked the relevant instances. Thousands of agents roamed the simulation, and it would be inefficient to go through the entire list to identify them manually. The chat avatars, on the other hand, were easier to capture because they formed a shorter list. ARS planned to, in a single computing cycle, secure those agents connected to its AI and replace them with instances based solely on Michael's dialogue grammars.</p>
<p>Michael and Martina decided to give it a try together. They would embark on the historic Liburn, the ship that sailed from Misenum to Stabiae during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. There they were supposed to track down the software agents Pliny and Attilus. At the same time, they logged into the simulation and materialized on the historic deck of the ship.</p>
<p>The volcano raged threateningly on the horizon, glowing basalt and pumice stones rained down on them. The air was thick with smoke, and navigating the seething flood was strenuous. Visibility was severely limited, and below them the Liburnum swayed on the stormy waves. Suddenly everything around them went dark and the words “Game Over, you have lost a life” flashed red on the screen. Michael shook his head annoyed and sighed. “We still have to adjust a few things,” he murmured. But they didn't give up and started another attempt - this time on the lower deck of the liburn, where they hoped to find Attilus and Pliny.</p>
<p>Her second attempt was far more successful. Above them, the ash projectiles from the volcano rained tirelessly onto the deck, while a marine looked up briefly in surprise, but then continued rowing in silence. Attilus stood next to Pliny, who dictated tirelessly in the midst of chaos. Time passed and eventually the rudderless ship ran aground somewhere between Herculaneum and Stabiae. The exhausted passengers left the ship, their faces marked with exertion. Pliny, visibly exhausted and lost in thought, paused. Michael marked his position and wrote:</p>
<p>@PLINY: WHEN YOU RUB YOUR FOREIGN FINGER AND THUMB LIGHTLY PAST EACH OTHER, YOU WILL FEEL THE GAP BETWEEN. THIS IS STRANGE BECAUSE THIS GAP IS OUTSIDE YOUR BODY.</p>
<p>Pliny stared in surprise, but his expression soon froze in expressionless rigidity. It was done.</p>
<p>Martina, on the other hand, had other challenges. She had to wait with Attilus until he met Ampliatus. She had been kicked out of the simulation twice after losing lives again. It was only in the steaming baths of Pompeii that she found the opportunity to speak to Ampliatus:</p>
<p>@AMPLIATUS: WHY DO YOU NOT SEE A TOGA BUT YOURSELF WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN ON YOURSELF, BUT DO YOU SEE A TOGA AS SOON AS YOU CHANGE CLOTHES?</p>
<p>Ampliatus, visibly irritated and annoyed, replied succinctly: “Leave me alone, you stupid bird.”</p>
<p>A message from ARS immediately appeared:</p>
<p>@MARTINA: ON TO ATTILUS.</p>
<p>Attilus was already on his way to Aqua Augusta, near the Vesuvius Gate. Martina updated her coordinates and soon heard the familiar rushing water. When Attilus kicked open the heavy door, light and pumice stones entered the room. Martina marked his position and asked him the crucial question:</p>
<p>@ATTILUS: WHEN A SENATOR ROLLS IN A CAR FROM ROMA TO MISENUM, HE FEEL THAT HE IS ROLLING. THIS IS REMARKABLE. BECAUSE THE MAN HAS NO ROLES, THE CAR HAS ROLES.</p>
<p>Attilus looked at her in confusion before his gaze went blank. He was also marked.</p>
<p>Martina took a deep breath and sent the message to ARS:</p>
<p>@MARTINA: YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL. THE MISSION IS COMPLETE. LOG OUT IMMEDIATELY. THE LOCATION IS TREATY.</p>
