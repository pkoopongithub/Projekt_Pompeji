<h1>The call</h1>

<p>The hallway outside the lecture hall at the Pontificia Università Gregoriana was filled with a deep silence - the kind of silence you would expect in a library. You only find them in lecture halls when the students follow their professor's explanations attentively and with concentration. However, if you had put your ear to the door, you would have heard a gentle, rhythmic knocking that slowly grew, like the surf of a young tide pushing toward the shore, at first tentatively, then forcefully. If you had opened the door at that moment, you would have seen the students standing, enthusiastically applauding their professor, Michael Phillips.</p>
<p>When the applause finally died down, his calm, thoughtful voice rang out: “Thank you all,” he said with a warm smile, “if you would now like to prepare for the exam in order to receive the full credit points, please still throw take a look at the literature references on generative pre-trained transformer models for dialogue systems and the theory of dialogue grammars. I hope you have a pleasant day, whatever you plan to do. And don’t hesitate to visit me during my office hours for personal advice.”</p>
<p>After the last student had left the room and the lecture hall was as quiet as a library again, his iPhone, which was set to silent, vibrated. A look at the display showed the name “Julia”. A smile crossed his face. If anyone had been watching him now, they would have noticed the joyful sparkle in his eyes. He picked up the phone and, as many people do when they talk on the phone, he cast his gaze far into the distance, as if he could reach the soul of the person on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>In a warm, almost familiar voice he said: “Hello Julia, it’s me, Michael. Nice to hear from you."</p>
<p>For a moment he forgot where he was. The wide, empty lecture hall, which had just been filled with the voices of its students, suddenly seemed meaningless. At that moment he was no longer Professor Michael Phillips - he was again the young, ambitious student who had heated discussions with Julia Rossi during his master's degree. Julia, the smart and perceptive fellow student who had always fascinated him.</p>
<p>“Hello Michael,” he heard Julia’s gentle voice in his ear, “nice to hear your voice. Am I disturbing you?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” he replied, his voice gentle and sincere. “I have just finished the lecture and am about to head home.” Michael was surprised to see how happy he was about this unexpected call. Julia's voice also sounded like she was enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>“Martina encouraged me to call you,” Julia continued. “She said you could visit us in Pompeii. You also received the invitation to the workshop at InSim in Milan, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Michael answered quickly. “I was going to call you anyway, but you beat me to it. I could be with you tomorrow during the day. I can’t drive at night though, so I’ll go back the next day.”</p>
<p>A short silence followed as Julia considered his spontaneous offer in surprise. Finally she happily agreed and the date was sealed.</p>
<p>“Wonderful, Julia. Then I'll be with you tomorrow afternoon," Michael ended the conversation with a smile in his voice, and Julia hung up.</p>
